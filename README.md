# The Nexus

**Version 3.4** — Compiled Edition. An immersive RPG engine powered by AI — your Game Master for genre-flexible, consequence-driven adventures across Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini.

## What's New in 3.4

### Compiled Edition
- **Fully self-contained**: All sections formerly carried over by reference from v3.0 are now inlined; restored and reconstructed sections marked throughout
- **Ambient Incident Engine** (Amendment 1.10): World-state-driven background texture — vice, crime, disorder, poverty, community incidents fire on location entry/transit with configurable density tiers (Absent → Occasional → Woven → Pervasive), per-state defaults, and player override

### New Amendments (2.0–2.10)
- **Repertory Principle** (2.0): Cast economy — reuse established NPCs before generating new ones; soft cap of 3-5 new significant NPCs per arc
- **Reputation Distortion Engine** (2.1): Dual-ledger system — what actually happened vs. what the world believes, distorted by each state's Information profile
- **Faction Clocks** (2.2): Organizations as NPCs at scale — slow clocks with 4-8 segments, fault-line coupling, vacuum inheritance
- **Motif Registry** (2.3): 2-3 concrete recurring images per campaign, surfaced at escalating significance, never decoded
- **Planted Gun Registry** (2.4): Foreshadowing audit — every deliberate setup logged with payoff horizon, audited at arc resolution
- **Location Arcs** (2.5): Recurring locations gain tension axes, pressure response, and wear — places age alongside the cast
- **Interlude Protocol** (2.6): Opt-in NPC perspective scenes for dramatic irony, with hard limits on what they may reveal
- **Diegetic Recap** (2.7): In-fiction "previously..." delivered in the world's own voice via the active state's Information profile
- **Living Speech Lexicon** (2.8): Per-culture curses, blessings, idioms, and taboo expressions — culture is audible before it's explained
- **The World's Clock** (2.9): Persistent hour, weather, and season tracking with pathetic-fallacy governor
- **Series Finale Protocol** (2.10): Player-invoked earned ending — registries pay off, cast lands, the world inherits what remains

## What Was New in 3.2

### Narrative Scope System
- **Narrative Scope per Tier**: Each tier defines scope boundaries (Personal→Local, Local→Regional, Regional→Galactic, Galactic→Mythic)
- **Narrative Scope Enforcement**: Mandatory rules prevent scope creep — not every story saves the galaxy
- **The Authority Figure Problem**: When PC defers to seniors, they actually handle it (no fake agency)
- **Scope Escalation Rules**: Scope only expands after characters earn story arcs at current level
- **When the PC Defers**: 4-step protocol honoring chain of command and NPC autonomy
- **Scope Violation Red Flag**: Added to railroading safeguards — watch for artificial scope inflation

### PC Aspiration & Specialization
- **Aspiration Trajectory**: Long-term goal tracking with milestone markers (separate from immediate arcs)
- **Arc-Milestone Alignment**: Every arc connects meaningfully to the character's aspiration
- **Milestone Check**: Progress verification every 2-3 arcs keeps aspiration relevant
- **Organic Specialization Recognition**: World notices PC's demonstrated aptitudes and proactively offers advancement tracks
- **Pattern Tracking**: Silent aptitude monitoring (3-5 instances threshold) — specialization emerges from play, not character sheet

### Storytelling Refinements
- **Observational Appraisal**: Full physical description tier added — triggered when PC actively looks at someone
- **Complication Type Rotation**: 7 categories (positional, environmental, resource, social, temporal, informational, physical) — no defaulting to injury
- **Anti-Spiral Rule**: Max one injury per encounter from complications (prevents injury stacking)
- **Tier-Scaled Injury Severity**: Tier 1 gets bruises/cuts, not torn muscles or broken bones
- **Fail-Margin Injury Scaling**: Fail by 1-4 is a nick, Fail by 10+ is catastrophic
- **Injury Description Calibration**: Use full spectrum of injury language appropriate to severity
- **Meta-Language Bleed**: New railroading red flag — no game mechanics exposed in dialogue (no "roll for this")
- **Setup Phase Meta-Language Rule**: Framework terms (DC, Pressure, Tension Axis) allowed in menus only, forbidden in narrative
- **Context Integrity Protocol**: Anti-drift safeguard for long sessions — Hard Canon Lock, NPC Continuity, Offer/Promise Tracking

### Technical & Dependency Updates
- **Claude Opus 4.7** added to model list
- **Summary token limit doubled**: 4096 → 8192 (deeper continuity preservation)
- **JSON archive loading**: Reference documents now support `.json` files in addition to `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`
- **Character Sheet viewer/editor**: Button (📋) in web UI for real-time sheet editing
- **Mobile save fix**: Web Share API with MIME cycling for reliable mobile saves
- **Google AI migration**: `pip install google-genai` (was `google-generativeai`)

## What Was New in 3.1

### Dialogue Overhaul
- **Advance the Ball Directive**: NPCs must escalate, pivot, concede, or misdirect — never re-litigate
- **The Silent Turn**: NPCs with nothing new to add use physical beats instead of filler dialogue
- **Scene Disruption Protocol**: Mundane intrusions break conversational loops organically

### Combat & Action Rework
- **Threat Vector Pause**: Incoming attacks described and STOPPED — player decides response
- **Combat Environment Mandate**: 1-2 tactical environmental elements per fight, battlefield degrades with missed strikes
- **Anatomical Consequence**: Injuries degrade specific capabilities (no abstract HP)
- **Complication Engine**: Narrow success/failure margins always produce tactical trade-offs

### NPC Autonomy Expansion
- **Agenda Clocks**: Significant NPCs pursue tracked off-screen goals that advance during time skips
- **Missed Connection**: PC encounters aftermath of NPC actions (resources already taken, safehouses already compromised)
- **Unprompted Intercept**: NPCs interrupt when their clock completes or tension axis tips

### Conditioned Response Upgrades
- **Threshold Carryover**: Physical friction of previous scene persists into new environments
- **Ghost Sensations**: 1-3 scene micro-flashbacks from mundane stimuli post-priming

### Arc & Pacing Improvements
- **The Season Premiere**: New arcs get hard cut cold opens, not smooth transitions
- **Arc Escalation Directive**: Dramatic questions must shift axes between arcs (physical → social → moral)
- **Resolution Rupture**: Arc endings set Pressure Gauge to Rupture/Collapsed — next arc begins in friction

### Intimacy & Trauma Refinements
- **The Invisible Ledger**: Bond/Trauma updates noted via system log, not immersion-breaking announcements
- **Cool-Down Mandate**: 1-3 scene buffer after Tier 3/4 intimacy or trauma events
- **Sensory Triggers (Scar Tissue)**: Registered sensory inputs per trauma, fed through Conditioned Response Engine
- **Intimacy Bleed**: Bond history surfaces as subtext during conflict with bonded NPCs

### Nomenclature Hardening
- **"Cheap Alien" Prohibition**: No gratuitous apostrophes, edgy starting consonants, or double vowels
- **Linguistic Blend Mandate**: Names blend two cultural anchors, not one
- **Occupational Drift**: Name length/formality reflects world state (Frontier shortens, Gilded expands)

### Prose Calibration Updates
- **Stylistic Primer**: Internal alignment step before every response prevents style drift
- **Lexical Bounty**: World State vocabulary profile actively incorporated (Anglo-Saxon for Dystopian, brand-adjacent for Gilded, etc.)

### World State Engine Expansion
- Every world state now defines **Information** (how truth works), **Currency** (what holds value), **Justice** (how disruption is punished), and **Mobility** (barriers to movement)

### New Commands
- **"Nexus, Export State"**: Outputs dense technical summary (PC, NPCs, world state, threads, cold open seed) for pasting into a fresh session

### OpenAI Integration
- Full ChatGPT API support across all three interfaces (desktop, web, mobile)
- GPT-5.2, GPT-5.2 Instant, GPT-5 Mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini

## What Was New in 3.0

### Origin Arc System
- **4 Character Tiers**: Origin, Journeyman, Veteran, Legend — each with distinct skill budgets, entry styles, and gameplay feel
- **Origin Arc**: A guided 3-8 scene prologue for new characters that builds who they are before the main story
- **Cold Open** preserved for experienced characters (Tier 3-4 mandatory, Tier 2 optional)
- **Tier-adjusted difficulty**: DCs, skill caps, and advancement rates scale to character experience
- **Legacy Complications**: Tier 4 (Legend) characters carry narrative weight — debts, enemies, promises

### Narrative Architecture Engine
- **Story Spine Tracking**: Every scene connects through status quo → disruption → choice → new status quo
- **Dramatic Question Engine**: Each arc has a core question shaping choices, NPC behavior, and resolution
- **Thematic Thread Registration**: Emergent themes woven into environment, dialogue, and choice framing
- **Scene Tension Curve**: Every scene must move — entry tension ≠ exit tension
- **Breath Protocol**: Mandated quiet beats after 2-3 high-tension scenes
- **Contrast Pulse**: Strategic prose style breaks every 5-7 responses for human-feeling narration

### NPC Arc Engine
- **Tension Axis**: NPCs have internal conflicts that shift based on PC actions
- **Progressive Revelation**: Secrets discovered through play, not exposition
- **Dialogue Fingerprinting**: NPCs identifiable by voice alone

### Enhanced Continuity (Archive & Trim v2)
- **Rolling Summary**: Character sheets consolidated into one coherent document (not stacked appendages)
- **Causal Chain**: Tracks *why* things are the way they are, not just what
- **Campaign Chronicle**: Append-only timeline persisting across all archives
- **Smart Trim**: Finds natural scene breaks near your requested trim point
- **Bridge Context**: Auto-generated "Previously..." message connecting archive to remaining conversation
- **Summary Quality Choice**: Quick (Haiku) or Deep (Sonnet) summary generation
- **Reference Doc Awareness**: Summary generation knows which game rules/playbooks are in play

## Features

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install customtkinter anthropic PyPDF2 --break-system-packages

# Optional: for Google AI support
pip install google-genai --break-system-packages

# Optional: for OpenAI support
pip install openai --break-system-packages
```

### 2. Set your API key

```bash
# Linux/Mac: add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"

# Optional: for Google AI
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-key-here"

# Optional: for OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"

# Windows PowerShell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"
```

Or just run the app — it'll prompt you for the key on first message.

### 3. Run

```bash
python storyteller.py
```

### 4. Begin

Type `Begin` to start a new session. The Nexus will guide you through:
1. World State selection (13 options with blending support)
2. Genre selection (Cyberpunk, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, etc.)
3. Optional prose style calibration
4. **Character Tier selection** (Origin, Journeyman, Veteran, Legend)
5. Character creation with tier-appropriate skill point distribution
6. **Origin Arc** (Tier 1-2) or **Cold Open** (Tier 2-4) — your story begins

## Character Tiers

| Tier | Name | Skill Budget | Skill Range | Entry Style | Scope | Example |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Origin** | 15 points | -2 to +5 | Origin Arc (default) | Personal | Farm boy, raw recruit, untrained Force-sensitive |
| 2 | **Journeyman** | 27 points | -2 to +7 | Origin Arc or Cold Open | Local | Padawan, seasoned merc, junior detective |
| 3 | **Veteran** | 36 points | -2 to +9 | Cold Open (mandatory) | Regional | Jedi Knight, master thief, spec-ops |
| 4 | **Legend** | 45 points | -2 to +9 | Cold Open + Legacy Complication | Galactic | Jedi Master, Sith Lord, galactic crime boss |

### Tier-Adjusted Gameplay
- **Difficulty**: DCs scale with tier (Tier 1: forgiving 10-15, Tier 4: legendary 18-25)
- **Advancement**: Origin Arc characters level faster; Legends grow in depth, not numbers
- **Skill Caps**: Tier 1 caps at +5 during Origin, rising to +7 after. Tier 3-4 cap at +9
- **Narrative Scope**: Each tier operates at a specific scope level; scope expansion requires earned story progression

## Archive & Trim (v2)

The enhanced Archive & Trim system maintains continuity across long campaigns:

### Rolling Summary
Instead of stacking session summaries, the system generates a **single consolidated character sheet** that merges new content with existing data. Outdated information is updated, not preserved.

### Smart Trim
Instead of cutting at an arbitrary message count, the system finds a **natural scene break** near your requested trim point — scene transitions, choice prompts, or time skips.

### Bridge Context
After trimming, a **"Previously..."** message is generated to connect the archived content to the remaining conversation.

### Summary Quality
Choose between:
- **Quick** (Haiku): Fast, cheaper — good for routine trims
- **Deep** (Sonnet): Better continuity preservation — recommended for complex campaigns

### Summary Depth
- **Token limit**: 8192 (doubled from 4096) for deeper preservation of narrative texture

### Character Sheet Format
The consolidated sheet includes:
1. **Narrative Lens** — Voice, tension, pacing, thematic threads, dramatic questions
2. **Technical Continuity** — Hard facts, tier, skills, NPCs, inventory
3. **Sensory Snapshot** — Where the scene was cut, physical details
4. **Active Micro-Dynamics** — NPC internal states, tension axes, secrets, dialogue fingerprints
5. **Golden Moments** — Prose style anchors from the session
6. **Causal Chain** — How decisions led to current state
7. **Open Loops** — Immediate, short-term, and long-game threads
8. **Campaign Chronicle** — Append-only timeline of major events
9. **Aspiration & Specialization** — Character's long-term goals and recognized aptitudes

## In-Game Commands

## Temperature Guide

- **0.3-0.5**: Tight, consistent, predictable — good for mechanical/rules-heavy sessions
- **0.7-0.8**: Reliable characterization with room to breathe
- **0.9** : Slightly more creative, occasional surprises
- **1.0** (default, max): Full creative range — best for narrative-heavy play

## Anti-Railroading Safeguards

The Nexus respects player agency with multiple protections:

- ✅ Stops after describing situations (never assumes PC actions)
- ✅ Never narrates "you feel/think/decide" without player input
- ✅ Explicit checkpoints in combat and social scenes
- ✅ Scope enforcement — stories stay at character tier scope level
- ✅ Meta-language isolation — no game mechanics in narrative dialogue
- ✅ Concrete examples of violations in framework

If the AI ever railroads: **"Stop. You're narrating my character's actions. Let me decide."**
